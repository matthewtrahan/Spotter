Grading Level:
Same grade for all members.

Differences:
Logging Data to keep track of progress. We implemented the progress tab
with a list of all exercises that segue to a graph. The user can input
a weight and the data will go into a Realm instance.

Special Instructions:
CocoaPods Minimum Version 1.2.1
Sometimes when opening the .xcworkspace file, the Spotter group would not
show, so you would just need to create that and use that group when running
the app.

Thanks for the excellent class!
